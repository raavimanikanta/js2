    <h1>What is Hoisting</h1>
    <h3>Hoisting is a phenomena by which we can access the variables and functions before we initialise it.</h3>
    <pre>
        var a=20;
        console.log(sum(6,4))
        function Sum (a,b){
            return a+b;
        }
        console.log(a);

        Output:- 
        10.
        20.
    </pre>
    <h1>Var,Let,Const</h1>
    <h3>
    <pre>
       Var is a functional scope and Global scope.
       In this Redeclaration and Reinitialization are possible
       
       let is a Block scope.
       In this Redeclaration and Reinitialization are not possible

       const is a Block scope.

    <h1>closure</h1>
    <h3>
    <pre>
      Functions bundled together with lexical-Environment forms the closure .If we want to invoke the function 
      which has alredy been vansihed or deleted from callstack .closures helps in maintaining the reference to which we are pointing .

    <h1>Temporal-Dead-Zone</h1>
    <h3>
    <pre>
      This is what the TDZ is: the term to describe the state where variables are un-reachable. They are in scope, but they aren't declared.
      The let and const variables exist in the TDZ from the start of their enclosing scope until they are declared.
